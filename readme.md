# Very Much - Work In Progress

First up just wanted to test the gem release.
 
Please check back in a few days....

Hope to make this similair to Testimonials, but with:
* Videos(youtube id) &/or Photo
* Homepage widgets (with rotating display of selections in BE)
* Operational for refinery 2.0

Items already included.
* BE/admin: Ability to load new recommendations with photo, video and company links etc.
* FE: Displays all recomendations data (except video) 

Items todo.
* Figure out how to include assets in the gem (images,css & js, yes help would be useful)
* style up the default views and home page widget
* figure out where to put the video and get it working.
